# SVM_and_KNN
Created supervised machine learning models on a dataset that contains information about heart readings and conditions, the goal was to predict if a patient has heart problems or not. 


This project containts ML concepts such as Support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor. 

I have attached the dataset for reference. 

I started by doing some EDA that tells us about the data and with visual representations 

Since the dataset has no missing values the only data pre-processing step taken was to scale the data so that the model can account for same weights for all data points

Finally, i proceed to apply SVM and KNN from sklearn to see how my model has performed.


I hope you learn something for it :)
